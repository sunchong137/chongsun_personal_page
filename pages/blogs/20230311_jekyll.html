    <h2>A Beginner's Note on Jekyll</h2>
    <div class="blueback">
        I made some beginners' notes on using Jekyll mostly based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB">YouTube tutorial</a>. 
        The notes are made with <a href="https://www.notion.so/product?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=2075789710&utm_medium=80211061601&utm_content=500427479647&utm_term=notion&targetid=kwd-312974742&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6rCgBhDVARIsAK1kGPKHfKKLPW9LTPGuZRJ3zYvufFNY6yI8t8ZFG9WsfGvvwf4DjdQKlegaAo7kEALw_wcB">Notion</a>,
        which is a free tool to manage projects, make notes, etc. 
        The link is <a href="https://lapis-light-e99.notion.site/Jekyll-Tutorial-77c91106a0f04a3484986f16f5d10b13">here</a>.  

        Sarcastically, this website is made by basic HTML, because I have not found my favorite Jekyll theme yet.
        <!-- I came across a paper where the authors described the empty sites as <i>holons</i> and doubly occupied
        sites as <i>doublons</i> for the Hubbard model. I should admit that this is my first time hearing 
        the two words! These names sounds cool, and audience like me absolutely will immediately doubt we slept 
        through our condensed matter classes. But are these names justified?

        As far as I know, the suffix <i>-on</i> is used for particles (e.g., electrons, protons, ions) 
        and pseudo-particles (e.g., phonons), and they are "quantized" with a specific energy assigned to 
        the particle.  -->
        <!-- Since February this year, I left the research team of Zapata Computing Inc. and
        became an independent researcher. My life has reduced to an alternation between 
        working at my desk and working in my garden.

        Being unemployed, I never feel the rush of finding a new job, because I do not find
        it meaningful to me to secure myself in some position. In the past seven years, my mind 
        has been unsettled because I did not know if I was going to be a great scientist.
