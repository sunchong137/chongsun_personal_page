    <h2>Notes on generative models</h2>
    <div class="blueback">
        My reading notes for generative models. I followed some lectures and a 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11970">review</a>  by Calvin Luo. 
        Here is the <a href="https://lapis-light-e99.notion.site/C-Luo-Understanding-Diffusion-Models-A-Unified-Perspective-3c3f5d82e5a94f41be9b4df6cdb93f97">link</a>
        to the Notion notes I made. 
        
        I tried to have more discussions on the motivations of the way the algorithms are designed.
        This note will be suitable for people like me who have good numerics background but are absolute 
        strangers to machine learning other than basic neural networks.
        <!-- I came across a paper where the authors described the empty sites as <i>holons</i> and doubly occupied
        sites as <i>doublons</i> for the Hubbard model. I should admit that this is my first time hearing 
        the two words! These names sounds cool, and audience like me absolutely will immediately doubt we slept 
        through our condensed matter classes. But are these names justified?

        As far as I know, the suffix <i>-on</i> is used for particles (e.g., electrons, protons, ions) 
        and pseudo-particles (e.g., phonons), and they are "quantized" with a specific energy assigned to 
        the particle.  -->
        <!-- Since February this year, I left the research team of Zapata Computing Inc. and
        became an independent researcher. My life has reduced to an alternation between 
        working at my desk and working in my garden.

        Being unemployed, I never feel the rush of finding a new job, because I do not find
        it meaningful to me to secure myself in some position. In the past seven years, my mind 
        has been unsettled because I did not know if I was going to be a great scientist.
